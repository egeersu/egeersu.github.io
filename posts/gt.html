        <h3 class="subsection"> Finite Strategic Form Game </h3>

        <p>
        We have a Set of Players \(N = \{1,2,...,n}\)
        * For each player $i \in N$
            * '$S_i = \{1, ..., m_i\}$' is a finite set of all possible pure strategies/actions. 
            * $S = S_1 \times S_2 \times ... \times S_n$ is the set of all possible combinations of pure strategies 
            * Payoff function $U_i(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n)$ returns payoff (utility) for Player $i$, when player $1$ plays $s_1$, Player $2$ plays $s_2$ ...
        
        * Each player $i$ wants to maximize its own payoff. 
        > **Zero-sum Game** is a game where, for all strategies $s = (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) \in S$
        > $$u_1(s) + u_2(s) + ... + u_n(s) = 0$$
        
        #### Mixed (Randomized) Strategy
        * Each player $i$ picks a probability distribution $x_i$ over all possible actions $S_i$
        $x_i$ is a vector of probabilities, therefore $x_i(1) + x_i(2) + ... + x_i(m_i) = 1$
        * $X_i$ is the set of all possible mixed strategies (probability distributions) for player $i$
        * **Profiles** of mixed strategies: $ X = X_1 \times X_2 \times ... X_n$ is the set of all possible combinations of mixed strategies that can be played by players $1,2,...,n$. 
        </p>

        #### Expected Payoffs 

        <h3 class="subsection">Mixed (Randomized) Strategy</h3>

        For each player $i$

        * $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \in X$' is a profile of mixed stragies (list of probability distributions)
        * $s=(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) \in S$' is a particular combination of pure strategies 
        
        We want to compute expected payoff for Player $i$ given $x$ and $s$.
        
        The **Expected Payoff** of Player $i$ under a mixed strategy profile $x=(x_1, ..., x_n) \in X$ is 
         
        $$U_i(x) = \sum_{s \in S}^{} x(s) * u_i(s) = x(s_1)u_i(s_1) + x(s_2)u_i(s_2) + ... + x(s_n)u_i(s_n)$$
        
        where \(x(s) = \prod_{j=1}^{j=n} x_j(s_j)\) is the probability of combination $s$ under mixed profile $x$. 
        
        Damn it ain't working.
